### 👋 Hello, I'm **Azimjon Akhtamov**

I'm an **AI Researcher** and graduate student at **Chungbuk National University (CBNU)**, specializing in:

- **Real-Time Computer Vision Systems**
- **Multimodal Fusion for Industrial Safety**
- **Lightweight Model Design & Deployment Optimization**

Under the supervision of **Prof. Aziz Nasridinov** at **DALAB**, I work on lightweight and robust AI solutions for industrial safety intelligence, covering PPE monitoring, fall detection, and hazard analysis.
My research focuses on creating efficient, deployment-ready vision systems and scalable multi-camera safety platforms for real-world industrial environments.

<!-- ## 📝 About Me

I’m passionate about **building practical, real-world AI systems**—not just models.  
I enjoy designing full pipelines: from **dataset creation**, to **model optimization**, to **production-level deployment** with dashboards, alerts, and multi-camera streaming.

Outside research, I create educational content for the Uzbek community on **YOLO, Computer Vision, and AI careers**, helping beginners enter the field. -->
