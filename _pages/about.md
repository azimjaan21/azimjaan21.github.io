I'm an **AI Researcher** and graduate student at **Chungbuk National University (CBNU)**.
Under the supervision of **Prof. Aziz Nasridinov** at **DALAB**, I work on lightweight and robust AI solutions for industrial safety intelligence, covering PPE monitoring, fall detection, and hazard analysis.
My research focuses on creating efficient, deployment-ready vision systems and scalable multi-camera safety platforms for real-world industrial environments.
