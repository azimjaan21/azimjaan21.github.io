### 👋 Hello, I'm **Azimjon Akhtamov**

I'm an **AI Researcher** and graduate student at **Chungbuk National University (CBNU)**, specializing in:

- **Computer Vision**
- **Multimodal Fusion**
- **PPE Compliance Monitoring**
- **YOLO-based Detection, Segmentation & Pose Estimation**
- **Real-Time Industrial Safety Intelligence**

I work with **Prof. Aziz Nasridinov** at **DALAB**, where I develop *lightweight, high-accuracy models* for industrial safety monitoring systems such as glove-wearing detection, helmet compliance, fire detection, fall detection, and multimodal PPE fusion.

My research focuses on building **fast, deployment-ready systems** using YOLOv8/YOLOv11/YOLOv12, hybrid segmentation-pose models, and custom backbones like StarNet and LKALite modules. I also design **real-time multi-camera platforms** (AI-COMS) using Django + React.

## 📝 About Me

I’m passionate about **building practical, real-world AI systems**—not just models.  
I enjoy designing full pipelines: from **dataset creation**, to **model optimization**, to **production-level deployment** with dashboards, alerts, and multi-camera streaming.

Outside research, I create educational content for the Uzbek community on **YOLO, Computer Vision, and AI careers**, helping beginners enter the field.

## 🌍 Motto

> "**Build AI that works in the real world, not just in benchmarks.**"

Feel free to explore my publications, projects, and blog posts.  
I'm always open to collaborations, new ideas, and advancing real-time AI systems for safer workplaces.
