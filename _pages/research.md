# Research

My work focuses on real-time, lightweight AI systems for industrial safety and multimodal perception.  
I aim to build models and platforms that operate reliably in real-world factory environments, enabling safer and more intelligent human–machine collaboration.

## 🔍 Core Research Themes

### **1. Vision-Based Intelligence & Lightweight Architecture Optimization**
I design efficient vision models for real-time perception, focusing on reducing computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.  
This includes lightweight backbones, optimized segmentation architectures, and deployment-friendly model redesign.

---

### **2. Multimodal Fusion for Industrial Safety**
My research integrates visual, pose, and contextual signals to improve the reliability of safety monitoring systems.  
Applications include PPE compliance detection, fall detection, hazard assessment, and zone-based risk estimation.

---

### **3. Real-Time Multi-Camera AI-COMS Systems**
I develop scalable video analytics platforms capable of running multiple streams simultaneously.  
AI-COMS is an end-to-end system that combines detection, segmentation, pose estimation, and alert generation for industrial safety environments.

### **4. Deepfake Detection & Multimodal Robustness**
Beyond industrial AI, I explore generalization in deepfake and synthetic image detection, focusing on robustness across GAN, diffusion, and AI-generated media.
